Please note that these are two separate approaches to achieve a similar goal, and the files in this repo are aimed more towards the first as it is implemented in a more simplistic form. This allows us not to have to delve too heavily into building our own code to achieve the same functionality (although most of those forum posts go into good enough detail to understand).

The articles should be cross referenced as well, as there are still some adjustments needed in regards to general compiler settings.
